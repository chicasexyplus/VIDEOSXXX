Adult Wordpress Theme Readme - First Steps
------------------------------------------
1. Upload the AWP theme folder to your wordpress theme folder.
2. Activate the AWP theme and enter your license key: Go to "AWP Settings" - "License", enter your key, click the "Save"-button and after that "activate".
3. Your should create some post categories for your videos. AWP uses the standard categories of wordpress.
4. Import and add some videos: Go to "AWP Import", enter a search term and hit enter, scroll down and chose a category to which you want to add the videos. You can also choose if you want to add the videos as "published" or "drafts".
5. We recommend to remove some of the wordpress standard widgets from the footer and add the widgets for search, recent posts, pages and categories.
For the Top navigation we recomment to ad a custom menu with a link to your homepage. And the widget for the categories and search after that.
